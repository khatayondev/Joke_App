# PyJoke WebApp

Welcome to **PyJoke WebApp** â€“ a simple, fun web application that delivers random programming jokes using the [pyjokes](https://pypi.org/project/pyjokes/) Python library. This project is built with Flask for the backend and vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

---

## Features

- **Random Programming Jokes:** Get a new joke every time you click the button.
- **Two UI Versions:**
  - `index.html`: Minimal, basic styling for quick prototyping or learning.
  - `index1.html`: Modern landing page with a hero section, responsive design, and enhanced user experience.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyjoke-webapp.git
   cd pyjoke-webapp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install flask pyjokes
   ```

### Running the App

1. **Start the Flask server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   - Visit [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

## Usage

- By default, the app serves `index1.html`, the enhanced landing page.
- If you want a minimal version, change the Flask route to serve `index.html` instead:
  ```python
  return render_template('index.html')
  ```
- Both versions allow you to fetch jokes by clicking the "Get a Joke" button.
